## First milestone delivery
Here is a description of the components and main features made for the first delivery.

- **Navbar Component**:
  - Contains the brand name of the eCommerce site.
  - Includes three buttons for future sections (Products, About us, Contact).
  - Currently, these buttons do not navigate anywhere.

- **CartWidget Component**:
  - Renders a shopping cart icon.
  - Displays a badge with a hardcoded number to simulate the number of items in the cart.

- **ItemListContainer Component**:
  - Receives a prop with a welcome message and displays it.

- **Styling and Responsiveness**:
  - Utilized Bootstrap to style the components and ensure the page is responsive across different screen sizes.

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can see the Navbar with the brand name and buttons for Products, About us, and Contact sections. The CartWidget icon with a badge and the welcome message from the ItemListContainer will also be displayed.
